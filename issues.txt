1. now I would like to archieve some features, primary is to extend the project make it a whole business website include landing page, course list/detail, library list/detail (virual, on site), Store/(Decoder,LEX vocabulary...), booking (front page), user interface (account) which allow user to manage bookings, orders, courses (submission eg. task, quiz...). the landing page you can quote https://dev.igpsedu.com/, the landing page static resourse(php, css) stored in /landingpageSRC.
2. the current area , taken as /dashboard area that used for tutors to build course and manage the students, and website settings (some further features we will create in the futher).
3. first I suppose to do is to restructure our project, /index /account / dashboard, and second, focus on the front page development and then make the landing page and courses and store area, and then do the addtional feature of the dashboard and the others.
4. combine above fragments give me you advices.
update the plan to clickup //https://app.clickup.com/9014065917/v/l/li/901409392385?pr=90140298904
1. I think the router /account and /admin can be identify the differ area, no need to use a dashboard.
2. I use jackyandsky@gmail.com Jacky789 not enter the admin area.
3. can you connect the supabase server using mcp ability? let me know which project you can control (should be "Course Builder").

sounds good, now all of pages under /admin work, then I want to discuss a question with you.
1. focus on the Proprietary Product/ Decoders area. I have a multiple content like this with title, content,... associate with a book. then I think if we can create a principle which allows us to create a category (of course in our category table) which can under the Proprietary Product section as subsections, such as decoders, complete study package, standardizer. when you create a category under the Proprietary Product, you can operate the subsection like the current decoder and enable you to create multiple subsection under the Proprietary Product.

I think we should change the decoder table to content table with a category column to identify them
1. no direct access to the page /proprietary-categories, I think should be a entry on the navigations bar the proprietary-categories label can be used to into the page and simultenously extend the subsection when enter /admin/proprietary-categories, occur error while add category //Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `ProprietaryCategoriesPage`.

1. on the page /admin/proprietary-categories when conduct add category then occur //Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `ProprietaryCategoriesPage`.
I have already launch the dev server at https://builder.vanboss.work/ you can use the credential jackyandsky@gmail.com Jacky789 to log in
using pupeteer to explore the /admin/proprietary-categories section, and test the add category function.
1. on the page /admin/proprietary-categories when conduct add category then occur //Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
2. when enter the page, on category list here, I think at least one category exist (Decoders)
1. the url: https://share.igpsedu.com/Proprietary%20Products/Standardizers/Complete%20Study%20Packet list all the complete study packet,
try to retrive the content and put title,content even related to a book that stored in our books library (if applicable), by the default user (4ef526fd-43a0-44fd-82e4-2ab404ef673c).
we should correct a mistake, about the content , we should contain title, content, these are the primary, but we only have 
description and title, now we should change the field description to content, that is the right name that we should use
claude-code add-mcp-server gemini -s user --command npx --args "-y" --args "github:aliargun/mcp-server-gemini" --env
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

when back to the content list page from detail, the sorting status changed, fix it. the status of the sorting      │
│   should keep during visiting the page and sub page
1. the url: https://share.igpsedu.com/Proprietary%20Products/Standardizers/Complete%20Study%20Packet list all the complete study packet,
try to retrive the content and put title,content and save them into seperate txt file and then I will copy them manually
1. actually, I am the owner of these pdf files. I have an idea, why we don't make a function that allow us to create a 
certain content by using one or more pdfs?
1. let us talk about the library and store, they are the similar page that express the list of the book (all the products we have are likely book content).
2. the list should cover all the basic functions filer search bar, pagination and so on, if the book do not have a image cover, then display a card with author and title (book), other we can image.
3. the details page include the basic information including the description and online buy button allow user to place order.
4. we can design a unify listing page , the only difference is the type I think. make the page professional and simple. looks nice.

the detail page looks awesome, but the course card looks no fancy, use extra thinking combine all the related
  parameters to make the card effective and professional

on the landing page (/src/app/public) , make the font and color restrict with the provided file located at /sample\landing
combine the content,style of our igps design a conprehesive about us page, no need to integrate with database.

the courses table have a field difficulty, we should have the values of enumeration (basic, standard, premium).
and we should simultenously change the relevant page like course creation /admin/courses/new and edit
and also replace the option level selector with these options at /courses

design a conprehensive user details interface, you can combine with features of our project
for example, teachers and admin can edit users profile and assign course, assign tasks, set level, note and so on, use extra thinking to brainstorm




[Supabase] Session refreshed on tab visibility
AuthContext.tsx:86 Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN jackyandsky@gmail.com
AuthContext.tsx:33 fetchUserProfile - Starting for user: 4ef526fd-43a0-44fd-82e4-2ab404ef673c

investigate which side the supabase entity runs on

let us focus on the enrollment flow, in the courses list page /courses, each card should point to the entry of 
guidance enrollment flow, once enter the enrollment page, should display basic, standard, premium three
level description and option list to choose and then go next, in the next step, should let costomers to choose
how many books they want to study in a study period or how much time? o across a periond such as one month, two month and so on,
help me design from the idea, and them we can talk about the improvement

perfect, the page content fits my mind. I would like to list improvement below.
1. in the /enroll, remove the title "Begin Your Learning Journey" area. remove the icon in the plan card and make the 
layout of the plan card tight, simple, fashion. the principle is try to make the page not that long for user. reduce the thoughts time.
2. do the same to /enroll/commitment.

1. in the /enroll/contact page, give the Learning Preferences section some multiple choose radios for convenience.
2. remove the Current Experience Level section. make the Learning Preferences and Preferred Start Date one line.
3. make the enrollment related page wider (accommodate more content reduce the hight) and the style match our landing page, use some gray colour, or backgroud colour.
understand the style (font, colour, and so on) of landing page and them make the enrollment related pages
an improvement, let them emphasize some key point through wording deviation
on the  reading speed section , the options better with 3-5 books,6-12 books and customized allow user to enter a specific number
and all of the options in the enrollment process better flaten a bit
in the Learning Preferences area, make the options badges look reduce the space, and after the flaten,
the dropdown(options) Components in the /contact page display half of the content

in the Learning Preferences area, make the options badges, look reduce the space, and after the flaten,

investigate 1. the supabse entity runs on the server side. 2. how many thread or process create a new supabase     │
│   entity? and then we can discuss the next

--
Based on my investigation, here are the findings:

  1. Supabase Entity Server-Side Behavior

  Your application uses multiple Supabase client creation patterns:

  Server-side (API routes):
  - createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies }) at src/app/api/content/upload-pdf/route.ts:45
  - createMiddlewareClient({ req, res }) at src/middleware.ts:7

  Client-side patterns:
  - Singleton pattern: getSingletonSupabaseClient() at src/lib/supabase/singleton-client.ts:44 with session timeout
   (2 minutes)
  - Direct pattern: createClientComponentClient() used directly in components like
  src/app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx:28

  2. Thread/Process Creation Analysis

  Current state:
  - ~20 Node.js processes running (including Next.js server processes)
  - Each API route creates a new Supabase client instance per request
  - Client-side components use either singleton or direct instantiation

  Key patterns:
  1. API Routes: New client per HTTP request (createRouteHandlerClient)
  2. Middleware: New client per request (createMiddlewareClient)
  3. Components: Mixed usage - some use singleton, others create new instances
  4. Service Layer: Uses singleton pattern (src/lib/supabase/courses.ts:5)

  Connection behavior:
  - Server-side: New connection per API request (no pooling)
  - Client-side: Singleton with 2-minute timeout + direct instances
  - Concurrent testing shows potential for multiple simultaneous connections
  (src/app/api/debug/connections/route.ts:51-88)

  The codebase has inconsistent client instantiation - some files use the singleton pattern while others create new
   clients directly, which could lead to connection proliferation.
https://claude-code.chatgptclaude.club/#/dashboard
   offer me a plan to fix the issue, we have to unify the mechanism of establishing only one supabase entity to 
   prevent entity conflict. I think this is the principle that leading supabase works well. based on your statement,
   only the Server-side (API routes):
  - createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies }) at src/app/api/content/upload-pdf/route.ts:45
  - createMiddlewareClient({ req, res }) at src/middleware.ts:7 should be kept, others shoud modify to apply them. and most use createMiddlewareClient, only 
  upload-pdf use the cookies one
 1. /admin/tasks,methods page the new page design looks weired need to normalize and the edit page white.
 2. /admin/methods page 
1. the /admin and sub pages can not render, you have to visit the landing page first, and then use the dashboard link to access the /admin
 and after /admin you are able to access the sub pages of /admin.
2. /admin/tasks,methods page the new page design looks weired need to normalize and the edit page white.

now we should investigate why when we switch to other tabs and then back to our website, the supabase client or    │
│   session dismissed, this time you can not fetch data, untill you refresh you current page, investigate the reason.  │
│   note that yesterday we modify all the supabase creation entity mechanism, we keep only three supabase entity       │
│   creation entry, 1 for normal(server side), 1for pdf parse(server), 1 for login (client session).

Key Problems Found:

  1. Instance Multiplication: Components create separate createClientComponentClient() instances
  2. Service Layer Conflicts: Services use middleware client with dummy req/res on client-side
  3. Session State Desync: Multiple clients checking session independently
  4. No Single Source of Truth: AuthContext exists but components bypass it

  Solution Ready:

  I've proposed a comprehensive 3-part solution:
  1. Singleton Pattern: Single shared client instance for all client-side components
  2. Enhanced AuthContext: Centralized session management
  3. Unified Service Layer: Smart client selection based on environment

  Next Steps:

  Would you like me to implement the proposed solution? I can start with the high-priority fixes:
  1. Update the singleton pattern in supabase.ts
  2. Fix the admin dashboard to use AuthContext
  3. Update service layer client detection

  This will resolve the tab-switching session issues and provide consistent authentication state across your entire
   application.

  1. time to add price and related properties to content, courses object that allow costomers to place order. and set a reasonable price, 50 dollar for each proprietary product, 7000 for each course.
  2. add the price to the card in the /course list.
  3. design all the pages which under the /account, this is our next focus.

  based on the content as of now we provided, design each page of the /account section, make them reasonable for future implement.

let us focus on the /account.
1. the user should access to /admin if they have access to /admin.
2. in the /account/courses area, display the course which assign to this user.

1. /account/courses, course list can be used to access to the related schedule (lesson list), the lesson card should indicate essential fileds,
such as (taken, tasks?, books, how many voca), each lesson card access to lesson content page (design later, key interface).
2. the lesson content page, show the content (richtext area) and essential fields, can be navigate to previous and next lesson next to it.
should display tasks if applicable. and other infor you can extra thinking.
1. /account/courses, the course card access to the /course/[id], shoud be correct to /account/courses/[id].
2. /account/courses/[id] this page ,should not have a options because when assign a course to user, the schedule (lesson group must be choosen), maybe we do not have this machanism? 
3. currently, the lesson list no show althrough you sepecific a schedule.

1. /account/courses/[id] the description of course should with style, not only plain text.
2. lesson still no show, not sure the reason below //{
    "code": "PGRST200",
    "details": "Searched for a foreign key relationship between 'lessons' and 'lesson_tasks' in the schema 'public', but no matches were found.",
    "hint": null,
    "message": "Could not find a relationship between 'lessons' and 'lesson_tasks' in the schema cache"
}
1. /admin/users/ when assign course to user, notice 'No schedules available for this course. Please create a schedule first.' the real is choosen a course with schedules. be carefully, do not confuse with /account/courses process.
1. I found the issues why no schedules available, once you retrive courses, no schedules be with at the meantime, I do not know which changes the process, AcademicProgress.tsx:129 Fetched, but check it , make sure the process between /accout/courses and /admin/user should be defferent.
1. /account/courses/, the description not richtext, should be richtext with style, and no corresponding schedule/ lessons show here.
/admin/lessons/[id]/edit
LEX - (Vocabulary Builder)
Standardizer - (Complete Study Support)
Decoder - (The Key unlocking any book)
#requirment
redesign the header menu layout of index page.
form the real course entities at least 3 complete version
place the complete study package under the standardizer
all the books 1387 stored in the supabase

1. we should establish a setting area, the layout style should like the page /account/courses.
2. in this area, there are sereral features in it, first we should maintain a comprehesive categories
relationship system.
1. in the /admin/setting/categories, the area Categories Management simplify the top category list with no badge or logo.
2. the sub category list, no need to list all of them, the list should have pagenates, and better to interact with the top
category. e.g. when clike a top categroy then display the sub category.
3.enhance the category edting modal, allow three-level classification, allow root category editing.

1. in the Root Categories area, when the items amount too much, the height will display long, it should be limited
as 10 items far, add a rolling button if the item exceed 10.
2. the content category is a sepacial one, so you should deal with defferently.

1. make sure the data exchange/ retrive meet the regulation that only allow api router with server side supabase entity.
2. the search bar dropdown changed event should not affect a page refresh, make it smooth render.
3. the content category contain several subcategory but no show.
1. set the content category as the direct parent of the subcategories that belongs to proprietary, and 
drop the category proprietary.
2. make the relevant modify with the dynamic router in our /admin .
3. and then put the complete study packages category belongs to standardizers.
4. make sure relevant functionalities works well with the changes
1. adjust the data structure add a field that allow this item show on the header menu or front index page, effected
tables include courses, content, books all the items are the direct product of our project.

 Typical Course Insert:

  {
    "title": from the list,

focus on the header, the dropdown occured by /store, now we have two column ,left stand for a mixed list which accommodate
the decoders, standardizers, complete study packages and Lex. right column stand for the category list of content.
we should modify this area because we want to display the list with the corresponding category.
1. keep the pattern of the left column, remove the category list. and from left to right should occupied with
Standardizers, Complete Study package, Decoders and LEX, include the category and up to 8 content list. the category (small text can link to the category of /store)

focus on the page /tools/genParagraph, can we use compromise to analyze the Generated Paragraph content,
  highlight the components of the paragraph and emphasize some selling error? I think we can add a button on the
  right of download, this advanced function enable user to understand the components of the paragraph and fix some
  spelling problem

  Failed to load resource: the /api/admin/orders?page=1&limit=20:1
server responded with a status of 403 ()
Error fetching orders: Error: Admin access required
    at fetchOrders hook.js:608 Error fetching orders: Error: Admin access required

and we should adjust the logic about the task submission creation, for now when the user submit the task then the  │
│   creation occured, I think is should be when the user enter the session then the associated submission created      │
│   automatecally and user can have two entries to submit: 1.the session detail page. 2. the submission page


1. Use the agent automatically
  npm run agent:watch  # Real-time monitoring
  2. Fix homepage APIs specifically
  npm run agent:fix src/app/api/navigation/homepage/route.ts
  3. Verify optimizations
  npm run agent scan --filter "homepage" --report

  1. Fix the 39 APIs with violations
  2. Add service layer where missing
  3. Ensure all APIs use createRouteHandlerClient
  4. Add proper error handling to all endpoints

  when user want to enroll a course from the /courses page , they will leading to the page /enroll,
  at this page we have three packages. the packages like a collection of services, including title, description,
  recommand level and services list, and also need price for this package, now in this page we have statistic three
  packages. now we should create a table in our supabase which allow us to store and edit the packages, only nessesory
  fileds needed, make it simple, effecient. the package is used as a complement of the course , when user want to 
  purchase a course they must take a package which determine what services they can take based on this course.
  the other important function the package act is it can determine the way of payment, there are two ways provided,
  1. is purchase directly like other products such as books or products decoders lex and so on. 2. is like current leading
  to a costom page leading user to fill the preset form and eventually to a booking page. the sepacial field of the 
  package is the service list, it should come with order, so I suggest to use jsonp to mark it. others compelement you can 
  brainstorm and give reasonable idea. the entry of /packages will locate at the  /admin/courses, because no other senario.

  when user choose the draft to explore the title of the modal should reflect the title of the draft selected
