### **Task Completion Report: Task 8 - Schedule Design System**

#### **Overview**

This task successfully implemented a comprehensive Schedule Design and Management System for the "Course Builder" application. The core of this system allows users to create detailed, recurring schedules (Schedules) that automatically generate individual lesson instances (Lessons) based on defined rules (e.g., "every Friday for 25 weeks"). The system features an interactive calendar for visualizing lesson plans and provides a full workflow for viewing and editing the content of each individual lesson, establishing a powerful foundation for course structure creation and long-term planning.

#### **Key Features & Functionality**

* **Advanced Schedule Creation**: A robust form was implemented to create schedules with detailed properties, including start/end dates, recurrence patterns (`weekly`, `daily`, etc.), specific class days, default lesson times, and duration.
* **Automatic Lesson Generation**: A service-layer algorithm (`generateRecurringLessons`) was developed to programmatically calculate and batch-insert all required lesson records into the database based on the parent schedule's rules.
* **Interactive Calendar View**: The `react-big-calendar` library was integrated into the schedule detail page to provide a rich, interactive visualization of all generated lessons over a month, week, or day view.
* **Lesson Details & Editing Workflow**:
    * Users can click any lesson on the calendar to open a modal (`LessonDetailModal`) displaying its current details.
    * From the detail view, users can open an editing form (`LessonForm`) pre-populated with the lesson's data.
    * Users can modify content fields such as the description, teaching notes, and homework, and successfully save these updates to the database.

#### **Technical Implementation Details**

* **Frontend**:
    * New pages were created for listing and viewing schedules (`/schedules`, `/schedules/[id]`).
    * New modular React components were built, including `ScheduleForm.tsx`, `LessonForm.tsx`, `ScheduleCalendar.tsx`, and `LessonDetailModal.tsx`.
    * State management on the detail page uses React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to handle data fetching, loading states, and modal visibility.
* **Service Layer (`schedule-service.ts`)**:
    * The service was extended with methods for full CRUD operations on schedules and lessons, including `createSchedule`, `getSchedule` (with nested lesson data), `updateLesson`, and `deleteSchedule`.
    * The core lesson generation and event transformation logic resides in `generateRecurringLessons` and `transformToCalendarEvents`.
* **Database**:
    * The schemas for both the `schedules` and `lessons` tables were extended using `ALTER TABLE` scripts to support the new, advanced features (e.g., `recurrence_type`, `duration_minutes`, `notes`).
    * New RLS policies were added for the `attendance` table to ensure data security (though this feature was later deferred).

#### **Known Issues & Next Steps**

The core functionality is in place and data is being managed correctly. However, two known issues must be addressed before this task can be considered fully complete and production-ready:

1.  **Calendar Controls Non-functional**: The primary issue is that the navigation toolbar on the calendar component (i.e., the "Next" & "Back" month buttons and the "Month/Week/Day" view switchers) is currently unresponsive. This prevents users from easily navigating through schedules that span multiple months. Resolving this is the highest priority next step for this module.
2.  **Schedule Editing Not Implemented**: While individual lessons can be fully edited, the parent `Schedule` entity itself cannot be modified after creation. The "Edit Schedule" button on the detail page currently links to a non-existent page and needs to be implemented to allow users to change a schedule's name, date range, or recurrence rules.
